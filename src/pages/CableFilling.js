          <p>
            Cable-filling compounds provide a watertight environment and
            protection against corrosion and potential dielectric problems (as
            well as other benefits). Often, these compounds are characterised by
            their high melting point, their water-resistant nature and their
            excellent dielectric properties, which slow down the deterioration
            of the cable during its service life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cable Filling Compounds (CFC) are basically highly crystalline in
            nature with excellent heat stability & high melting potential. CFCs
            are widely used in telecommunication industries. They are prepared
            and developed according to specific requirements of the clients.
            CFCs are easily compatible with the Jelly Filled Cables and have
            good thermal and oxidation stabilities. They can be applied into the
            cable manufacturing process from 90째C to 95째C temperature in
            semi-liquid techniques and from 100째C to 105째C temperature in liquid
            techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            CFC when heated, can be poured and once it cools, forms into a hard
            mass. It has low water vapour permeability, and is insoluble in
            water and subsoil chemicals. It also gives an excellent performance
            for electrical application. It offers resistance to weathering and
            to chemical reactions.
